# code-portfolio
Here you can find examples of some of the scripts I have written for each of the games in my portfolio.

Frontier contains the largest number of examples as this shows my best and most recent work.

This includes many intermediate and advanced level programming techniques such as:  
Coroutines  
Inheritance   
Events  
Callback functions  
Interfaces  
Object pooling  
Preprocessor directives
